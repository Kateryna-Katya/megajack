        <div class="about-wrapper">
            <p>Look, we built Forest Dreams because we wanted something that's more about getting lost in the atmosphere instead of
            just spinning like crazy.</p>
            <p>It draws inspiration from Hayao Miyazaki’s visual storytelling and traditional Japanese folklore, where nature is alive
            and spirits are part of the world, not separate from it.</p>
            <p>Everything in the forest happens at its own pace - you'll see energy building up, symbols moving like they actually mean
            something, and when stuff changes, it feels like you worked for it. If you're the type who likes to take your time and
            actually pay attention to what's happening, you're gonna love this.</p>
